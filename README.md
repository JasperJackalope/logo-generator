## License

    This project has no license.

## Installation

For this to run properly, you must install Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download) and Inquirer Package v.8.2.4 (https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4).

## Usage

A user will be presented with a series of prompts asking questions to style the logo. First, they will be asked to input up to three characters to be displayed and which color they would like the text to be. Next, they will be able to choose a main shape (circle, triangle, or square) for the logo and also select which color. The svg file will then be created, displaying the correctly colored text on the correctly colored shape.

## Contributing

My amazing TA Shawn deserves all the credit for walking me through the initial steps of test-based development and getting me up for success with the rest of the code. Also thank you to my instructor Bryan for helping me with that one error I just couldn't find. I used W3 and Mozilla Developer to fill in the gaps and flesh out the code. 

## Tests

There are two test files for the SVG and Shape classes - shapes.test.js and svg.test.js which can be run to test the functionality of the logo creation. To run, enter "npm run tests" in the terminal.
